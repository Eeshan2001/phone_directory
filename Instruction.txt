Here I have Created a terminal application (CLI app) to manage our contact book using Python

Features of the Contact Book:

Our Contact Book application will be a terminal-based application. 
Similar to a Todo application, we can perform the following operations on it:

Add (or Create): You can add a new contact in the contact book.
Show (or Read): You can see all your contacts saved in the contact book.
Edit (or Update): You can edit the contacts saved in the contact book.
Remove (or Delete): You can delete the contacts saved in the contact book.

Steps: download the code folder and open CMD and perform following instruction

1. python main.py --help
2. python main.py show
3. python main.py add --help
4. python main.py add "Eeshan" "+91 7543946134"
5. python main.py add "Mayur" "+91 7218994313"
6. python main.py edit 1 --name "Eeshan C" --contact-number "+91 7239311343"
7. python main.py remove 2
